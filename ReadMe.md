# Engineering Foundations

This repository was created to help me **learn quickly how to build end-to-end data science projects**.

It gathers knowledge sheets covering:
- data science and machine learning concepts
- statistical foundations
- software engineering and data engineering tools
- cloud, orchestration, and deployment practices

The goal is to connect **theory and practice**, and to understand how different tools and concepts work together across the full lifecycle of a data project.

## Purpose

This repository is my **long-term knowledge base**:
- a place to store what I want to understand deeply and remember forever
- a way to build strong mental models rather than isolated notes
- a reference to revisit before projects, interviews, or technical discussions

## Structure

The repository is organized by domain:

- Shell & development environment
- Version control
- Programming & data
- Backend & APIs
- Data engineering
- Containers & deployment
- Cloud
- Machine Learning

Each topic is documented in a dedicated Markdown file.

## Living repository

This repository is **continuously improved and refined**.
All suggestions, corrections, and improvements are welcome.

If someone else can **find value or benefit** from this work, I would be very happy — that is also part of its purpose.
